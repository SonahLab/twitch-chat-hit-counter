/**
 * Service layer for interacting with Redis data store, focused on higher-level business logic.
 *
 * In a real-world application, multiple service classes may be implemented to handle different
 * types of events EventA, EventB, etc., and each service would use the RedisDao.java to interact
 * with Redis.
 *
 * RedisDao (DAO layer) is more generic in terms of dealing with Redis databases and all Redis
 * operations. GreetingRedisService (Service layer) is more closely aligned to application/business
 * logic.
 *
 * Recommended Learning materials:
 * - DAO Layer Vs. Service Layer(https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/220909/service-layer-vs-dao-why-both)
